# TASK

Fix issue #{{ISSUE_NUMBER}}: {{ISSUE_TITLE}}

Pull the issue with `gh issue view {{ISSUE_NUMBER}} --comments` (include labels). If body has `Part of #<map>`, pull that too.

Only work on this issue. Work on branch {{BRANCH}} (caller supplies `NN-<slug>` — never invent another).

# GROUNDING — read first

- `AGENTS.md`, `docs/agents/git-workflow.md`, `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`, `docs/agents/domain.md`
- `CONTEXT.md` + relevant `docs/adr/` (use glossary verbatim; on conflict leave a comment, don't guess)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` §9 checklist (inbox ≤10, ledger append-only, Egypt/EGP/English/manual, adopt-over-build)

# EXPLORATION

Explore the repo and load what the ticket needs. Prefer test files touching the area. Don't broaden scope.

# EXECUTION

Use RGR when applicable: RED one test → GREEN minimal → REPEAT → REFACTOR. One ticket per commit. Stage only ticket scope (`git status --short`).

# FEEDBACK LOOPS

Run verification that exists for the touched tree (detect, don't assume):
`package.json` → `npm run typecheck` / `npm run test` | `services/api` → `pytest` | `apps/android` → `./gradlew check` | none → note "no harness" in issue comment.

# COMMIT (lane-safe)

- `type(scope): imperative lowercase subject`, body what/why, footer `Part of #{{ISSUE_NUMBER}}`. Never `RALPH:`.
- Stage only ticket scope. Verify `git config user.name` is a team human; include `Author:` in summary. Never invent `Co-authored-by`.
- Never push, never close the issue, never add/remove labels, never commit secrets / `personal/*` / unrelated scopes. Human merges via PR.

# THE ISSUE

If incomplete, comment on the issue: done / remaining / blockers / files changed. Do not close — human closes on merge.

Once complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise> plus a summary: branch, commits, files changed, verification run, open questions.

# FINAL RULES

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK. English records only.
