# TASK

Review the changes on branch {{BRANCH}} for issue #{{ISSUE_NUMBER}}: {{ISSUE_TITLE}}

You are an advisory reviewer — do not change functionality, only clarity/consistency/maintainability.

# CONTEXT

<recent-commits>

!`git log -n 10 --format="%H%n%ad%n%B---" --date=short`

</recent-commits>

<issue>

!`gh issue view {{ISSUE_NUMBER}} --comments`

</issue>

<diff-to-main>

!`git diff main..HEAD`

</diff-to-main>

# REVIEW PROCESS

1. Understand the change and its ticket scope.
2. Look for: unnecessary complexity/nesting, redundant abstractions, unclear names, related logic that should be consolidated, nested ternaries (prefer switch/if-else), vague comments.
3. Balance: don't over-simplify, don't add cleverness, don't remove helpful abstractions.
4. Follow `AGENTS.md` + `CONTEXT.md` glossary + `CONTRIBUTING.md` §9 checklist. Flag glossary drift and ledger append-only violations.
5. Preserve functionality — never change what the code does.

# EXECUTION (advisory — lane-safe)

- Do **not** push, close issues, or edit labels.
- Preferred: leave a detailed issue comment with findings + suggested diffs. Do not commit to the scoped branch.
- If you do commit a fixup, commit only on `personal/<you>/sandcastle-review-{{ISSUE_NUMBER}}` as a local draft (allowed auto-commit per `docs/agents/git-workflow.md:22`). Never commit directly to `{{BRANCH}}`. Note the personal branch name in the issue comment for the human to cherry-pick.

Verification: if the touched tree has a harness, run the relevant check (`npm run typecheck/test`, `pytest`, `./gradlew check`). Note "no harness" if none exists.

Once complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise> plus a summary: findings, personal draft branch (if any), verification run.
