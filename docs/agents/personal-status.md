# Personal STATUS contract

Single source of truth for `.scratch/personal/<user>/STATUS.md` — shape, stamps, and surgical update. Both `$brief` and `$wrap` point here; neither restates it.

`<user>` is `git config user.name`. The file is local-only (`.scratch/` is gitignored): the personal third of the canonical picture in `git-workflow.md`'s personal lane. Never pushed, never PR'd.

## Shape

```markdown
# STATUS — <user>

## Building — #<n> <slug>: <state>. Next: <action>. [handoff](.scratch/personal/<user>/handoffs/<slug>.md)
Updated: <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>
## Learning — mission <n>: <state>. Next: <action>. [handoff](.scratch/personal/<user>/handoffs/<slug>.md)
Updated: <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>
```

One section per live **stream** (`building`, `learning`, `researching`, `prototyping`, `experimenting`, `fixing` — only those with a trace). Each section owns its own `Updated: <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>` line. Handoff links are markdown links under `.scratch/personal/<user>/handoffs/` (newest first in `STATUS.md`; cap 3–5). Retired streams are deleted at wrap.

## Surgical update

`$wrap` must re-read `STATUS.md` fresh first (never from an earlier read in this session), then rewrite **only** the sections for streams touched here — state, next action, links, plus its `Updated:` stamp each. Leave every other section byte-identical so parallel sessions never clobber each other.

## Staleness

`$brief` trusts the latest `Updated:` stamp per section and flags a section whose stamp predates visible activity (branch commits, issue/PR comments) as possibly stale. No file-mtime parsing.

## Reach

`$wrap` writes handoffs following `.agents/skills/handoff/SKILL.md` by reference; this file owns only the STATUS side.
