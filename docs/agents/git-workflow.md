# Git workflow: branches, commits, pushes

Three lanes govern every agent git action: **primary** (shared, protected), **scoped** (one issue, shareable), **personal** (one dev, local-only). Work in exactly one lane at a time.

## The three lanes

- **Primary**: `main` only. `master` is legacy and deleted. Land work here through a PR from a scoped branch. A direct commit on `main` needs a separate explicit human confirmation of the diff plus the message, and is the exception, not the flow.
- **Scoped**: one GitHub issue, one short-lived branch, deleted after merge. Scope comes from the issue number, ownership from the issue assignee. Everything meant to be shared lives here.
- **Personal**: `personal/<user>/<topic>` branches plus files under `.scratch/personal/<user>/`. Local-only, never pushed, never opened as a PR. Learning, exploration, and experiments live here. This is the sole exception to the issue-number rule.

## Branch naming

- Create a scoped branch only with explicit human intent (ticket claimed or assigned first, or the human named the issue). Format is strict: `NN-<kebab-slug>`, where `NN` is the GitHub issue number, e.g. `07-define-inference-points`. Lowercase kebab-case after the dash, no bare names (`fix`, `stuff`, `test`).
- Create a personal branch freely without an issue: `personal/<user>/<topic>`, e.g. `personal/layla/interest-math-notes`. It stays local by construction.
- Check `git branch` and the issue assignee before creating anything; a branch whose number has no issue, or whose issue belongs to someone else's ticket, is a naming bug: stop and ask.

## Issue labels (closed set)

- Use only documented labels: `wayfinder:map`, `wayfinder:research`, `wayfinder:prototype`, `wayfinder:grilling`, `wayfinder:task`, `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`.
- Propose a new label in the issue body and wait for approval before applying anything ad-hoc. Scope and ownership live in the issue title, body (`Part of #<map>`, `Blocked by: #<n>`), and assignee, not in invented label strings.

## Commits: show, then wait

For every commit, on any lane except `personal/*`:

1. Stage only the ticket's scope: `git status --short`, plus the full diff of exactly what will be committed.
2. Present the diff stat, the diff itself (or its path when large), and the proposed message, then wait for an explicit Yes or an edited message.

Commits on `personal/*` are local-only drafts (never pushed, never PR'd): they may be created without waiting for an explicit Yes. Author must still be a team human (`git config user.name` check still applies), hygiene still applies, and promotion to `NN-<slug>` or `main` still requires the Yes gate above.
3. Message shape: conventional commits — `type(scope): imperative lowercase subject` on line one (e.g. `docs(agents): reserve import_id fields on ledger entries`), body explaining what and why, footer naming `Part of #NN` with the ticket link. One ticket per commit. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`. Scope is the area touched (`agents`, `api`, `android`, `ledger`, …).
4. Commit only on the intended branch. On `main` this needs the separate primary confirmation from above; on a scoped branch the earlier branch intent plus this commit confirmation together authorize it.
5. Commit hygiene: skip nothing via `--no-verify`, amend only your own unpushed commit, stage no secrets (`.env`, tokens), no `personal/*`, no unrelated scopes in one commit.

## Commit identity: humans author, agents assist

- These rules bind every AI actor in the loop — agent harness and underlying model alike. Every commit is authored by one of the team humans: `AdelTamer35`, `mohamedelawakey`, or `IBruteDude`. No AI actor commits under a bare agent or model identity (e.g. `wellfin-agent`).
- Before proposing any commit, read `git config user.name` and `git config user.email` and verify the name is one of the three. Show the resolved `Author: Name <email>` line as part of the commit proposal. When the config holds a bare agent identity or an unknown name, stop and ask who is authoring instead of committing.
- Author email is the GitHub noreply form `USERNAME@users.noreply.github.com`, so commits link to the right profile without exposing real emails. Each machine owns its human's config; the agent reads and verifies it, never silently overwrites it.
- When an AI actor wrote the committed content wholesale and the author approved it without modification, append a free-form footer below the body: `Assisted-by: OpenCode (Muse Spark)`. A real `Co-authored-by:` trailer is reserved for when the team owns a bot account with a linked email; never invent a GitHub identity or placeholder email to force the co-author rendering.

## Pushes

- Commit approval on a pre-authorized scoped branch carries push approval for that branch: push it upstream without a second prompt so review can happen.
- Push nothing else on that approval: `personal/*` is never pushed under any approval, and `main` is never direct-pushed (open a PR from the scoped branch instead).

## Landing PRs

- Land every PR with a squash merge: one commit per PR on `main`. Never run a bare squash.
- Merge with an explicit message, never the pre-filled default (PR titles stay free-form and are never the commit message):
  `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch -t "<conventional subject> (#N)" -b "<what/why plus footer>"`.
- Squash message shape: conventional-commit subject + ` (#N)` suffix, body for what/why, footer `Part of #NN` (or `Closes #NN` when the PR finishes its issue). One ticket per squash. The merger composes it at landing time.
- Stacked PRs land bottom-up: retarget each child's base to `main` *before* merging anything, then squash the base, then transplant the child with `git rebase --onto <new-main> <old-base> <child-branch>` (replaying only its own commits, dropping the now-duplicated base commits), push with `--force-with-lease`, and squash it. Retargeting first means deleting the base branch closes nothing — the child's diff just looks inflated until the transplant.
- Delete the scoped branch after merge.

## Personal stays local; findings get promoted

- Keep personal work invisible to the team: no `git push` involving `personal/*`, no PR from it, no issue comment pointing at personal paths. `.scratch/personal/` stays untracked and out of scoped commits.
- A finding graduates from personal to shared when it changes a shared decision, glossary term, or unblocks a ticket (decision-impact trigger). Then propose the promotion and wait: a clean `NN-<slug>` branch, a focused commit following the rule above, and the PR or issue comment that carries the finding. Copy the finding out; leave the personal original local.
